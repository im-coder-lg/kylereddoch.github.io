I have always had a hard time keeping up with habits. I have even tried various apps to help me but they were just not working out for me. So I did as anyone would do, I went on the hunt for another one.

Luckily I found this app called Forte from a one of my friends on Twitter, [Collin Daugherty](https://twitter.com/collindaugherty). This app fits all my needs and plus, it looks just beautiful.

## What is Forte?

What sets this habit tracker apart from all the others out there is, it doesn't punish you for having a "bad" day. Forte doesn't do streaks. Their motto is, **"Build Habits, Not Streaks."** When you have a habt tracker app that works on streaks, you build up those streaks to just one day having them return to zero because you didn't do your habit. ICK! Forte, uses a custom algorithm that it runs your habits through and presents your score based on performance. Your score won't go down just by missing a day. YAY!

## Features

Forte is full of features.

- Habit tracking multiple times in a day (up to 100 times)
- Unlockable achievements (make progress on your habits and earn achievements)
- WIDGETS (keep track of your habits straight from your homescreen)
- Privacy lock (keep your habits away from others) - uses TouchID or FaceID

The free version of the app is limited to tracking 3 habits. After that, you will need to purchase Forte Premium.

## Premium Features

- Track umlimited amount of habits
- Customize the app icon and app accent color

Collin has really built an amazing app in Forte and it shows. If you are looking for a better habit tracker, I cannot recommend Forte enough.
