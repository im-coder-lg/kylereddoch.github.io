I have always been a huge fan of Apple devices. The quality of the devices is something to be amazed at. If only someone would frame them so people can hang them up for decor. Oh wait, this has been done.

Grid Studio creates wonderful, framed wall decorations consisting of Apple devices (and others too - like Gameboys and Samsungs) for us to gaze at. They not only put the device in the frame but break the device down component by component including labeling each one. Being able to see the insides of the device shows their beauty. Grid Studio also breaks down the dimensions of each component to add some "flair" to it.

Grid Studio was generous enough to send me a couple of devices for this review. I was sent the iPhone 4S and Apple Watch Series 1. Both of these devices were remarkable when they debuted. I can still remember getting each device for the first time. The iPhone 4S was the 3rd iPhone I owned and the Series 1 Apple Watch was the first-ever smartwatch I had. Seeing these devices framed brought back so much nostalgia.

### Conclusion

One thing is certain, Grid Studio took into account every possible detail of each device that you could, and elegantly framed it all for lasting display. If you are an Apple fan and want to grab a piece of technological history, or want to gift it to someone, Grid Studio is the best solution by far.
