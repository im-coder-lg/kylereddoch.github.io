Technology has always been at the core of my life. Ever since I was a young child, I have been fond of technology. There‚Äôs just something about tech that opens up new possibilities to a person. Being able to help people learn new technologies brings me joy.

I have gone too long without creating a place to write about technology and continue helping others.
