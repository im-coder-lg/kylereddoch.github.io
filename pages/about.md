Technology has always been at the core of my life. Ever since I was a young child, I have been fond of technology. There‚Äôs just something about tech that opens up new possibilities to a person. Being able to help people learn new technologies brings me joy.

I have gone too long without creating a place to write about technology and continue helping others.

[Here's what I'm up to right now](/now/)

### Shortcuts

[Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) has allowed me to simplify many aspects of my daily life. Now that Shortcuts is available for Mac too, even more applications are possible.

Stuck on a shortcut? Have an idea and not sure where to start? Just want to say hi? Feel free to reach out to me [@winphankyle](https://www.twitter.com/winphankyle) on Twitter.

You can also check out my [Shortcuts Gallery](/shortcuts-gallery/) where I have tons of Shortcuts that I've created for various tasks and routines.
