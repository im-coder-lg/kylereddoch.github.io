## What's New?

It's another month so another update for what I'm doing right now. Nothing much has changed since last time I wrote. Time is getting closer to me starting college. I am both ready and a little scared at the same time.

I have also started developing scripts for [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) using javascript. The first script that I created was to collect data from the [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com) API via JSON and display the combined stats from the last 7 days. The script can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kylereddoch/scriptable) and has been submitted to the Gallery on the Scriptable app. My next script I'm working on will be for RescueTime and will be a little more indepth.

Well that is all I can think of right now.

### Apps I'm Using

I haven't been able to try to many new apps.  These are the notable ones I have been using.

**[Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com)** is a full-featured Git client for iOS/iPadOS.  I have been using this app for a few weeks now and I have to say, this is a well put together app. The features are amazing and you can even work offline.

**[TV Time](https://www.tvtime.com)** allows you to track the TV Shows you are watching/watched and even the movies. It's like a social media for entertainment.

**[AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html)** is an app that goes beyond blocking ads on the web. A full-featured privacy assistant, it protects you from tracking, phishing, and all kinds of fraudulent activities ‚Äî while also letting you regulate protection levels on your own. The app is built for macOS and works with all browsers. A powerful safety shield your Mac deserves. AdGuard is also available for iOS/iPadOS.

### Books I'm Reading

I have slacked on reading any books as of late. üôÉ Hopefully that will change.

### What I'm Watching

I have been focused on development lately that I haven't watched much shows, I am getting behind.

**Lost in Space** season 3 finally came out on Netflix. Been waiting for that for awhile. Can't wait to catch up with the Robinson's.

**Yellowstone** season 4 is in full swing and the Dutton's are out for revenge. This is going to be a battle filled season for sure.

### Hobbies I'm Active With

Well, let's see...

Still playing around with Shortcuts? Diving more into developing Scriptable scripts? Creating open-source tools for people to use? Learning as much as I can?

I think that sum's it up for this update of What I'm Up To Right Now. Until next time, cheers üçª.
