## What's New?

Well it is a new year! This year has started off busy for me. I started back up at college on the 3rd and it has been full steam ahead ever since. Right now I am just taking some gen ed classes but working fulltime also, it doesn't leave much time for other stuff. I also just before the new year switched over to using Trakt as my database for watched tv shows/movies and watchlists. You can check out my profile above.

I do have some exciting reviews in the queue. Again, cramped for time so it's taking a little longer than expected. There is a few interesting apps as well as products from [Nomad](https://nomadgoods.com), so be on the lookout for those! If you are not subbed to my RSS feed, you can do so [here](https://www.kylereddoch.me/feed.xml), that way you never miss a new article.

### Apps I'm Using

**[Forte](https://fortehabits.com)** - Forte is a habit tracker app but not like all the others. It doesn't keep streaks therefore if you miss a day, it doesn't ding you for it. I have been using this app for about a month now for various habits like reading the Bible, doing my daily reflections, etc. and have really enjoyed it. The app is really well designed and visually appealing.

**[Trakt](https://trakt.tv)** - I started using Trakt just before the end of last year. I switched from using TV Time. Trakt allows you to track tv shows and movies that you watch. You can follow other users to see what they watch and get new ideas. It is a really nice community of users.

**[CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com)** - CleanShot X is a screen capture tool on steriods. It is like having 7 tools but all in one app. It provides over 50 features making it the only screen capture tool you'll need.

### Books I'm Reading

Book reading has been shelved (*pun intended*).

### What I'm Watching

**1883** has been truly amazing to watch so far. Just like Yellowstone, it is always intriguing to watch. Although, **spoiler alert**, I didn't really like when they killed off Enis.

**The Shrink Next Door** is getting off to a slow start for me. Maybe it is because of the serious roles of both Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell. They have always been the funny, comedic actors. One thing I do know is, I already want to beat up Paul Rudd's character!

**This is Us** I have been watching this show since the beginning. It is such an amazing and emotional show. This is the last season, the final chapter, and I'm not ready for it to end.

### Hobbies I'm Active With

Well from now and for the next 4 years, my main hobby will be getting through college. Around that, I am still working on learning Swift and SwiftUI, developing Scriptable scripts, and just keeping up with my development skills.

I think that sum's it up for this update of What I'm Up To Right Now. Until next time, cheers üçª.
