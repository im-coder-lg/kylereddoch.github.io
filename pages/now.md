## What's New?

As I am here writing this, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to organize all this. Well, let's start...

Recently I decided to go back to school and get my Bachelor's in I.T. with a concentration in Software Development. I went with Southern New Hampshire University online mainly because the tuition price was low. I am getting everything ready and organized for when I start on January 3rd.

This is going to be a change since I haven't been in college regularly since 2006. Before my middle child was born I did a few semesters at a local community college here but never finished as I left to help with our newborn at the time. Then again in 2015 I went to University of Phoenix online but again didn't finish. The time just wasn't right.

I'm also using this opportunity to get me a new MacBook Pro! The current one (2017 model), won't have enough space on it for my schooling. I have decided to go with the new 14" model with the M1 Pro in it.

I have also started my journey in app development. I started learning Swift/SwiftUI so I can develop for the Apple ecosystem. I found this really cool site by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) called [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com). His [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) and [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) are amazing. He has videos, tutorials, and more to help you learn both.

I also started this site/blog as a place to share technology and hopefully help and make a difference in people's lives. It has been too long without doing this so here we are. If you enjoy reading my posts and the tools I create, let me know, I love hearing from people. If you're feeling like supporting what I do/create, you're more than happy to do so. You can find the different options to support me [here](/about/).

## Stuff I'm Reading

I am starting the Develop in Swift (Xcode 12 version) guides from Apple Education. I am positive this will help and guide me in my development journey.

## Things I'm Watching

**Yellowstone** - Being from Montana, this series peaked my interest. Honestly I started in late and was able to binge watch seasons 1-3 in no time. I have to say, this show is suspenseful. The acting is really good, plus you can't go wrong with Kevin Costner. I am eager to see what season 4 has to bring.

**Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol** - I have been a fan of Dan Brown's - Robert Langdon movies. The Lost Symbol is a book in the series that was made into a TV series. I am a little confused though becase chronologically, it is the 3rd book. The movies has an older Robert Langdon but this series features a younger Langdon. That aside, I am really liking this series. Maybe it is just the history lover in me.

**Foundation** - Any Si-fi lover will know about the Foundation series of books by Issak Asimov. This series from Apple TV+ follows that series. I honestly have to say that I never read the books (I am really bad about getting into reading) but this series is really amazing. Looking forward to finishing it to give a better review.

**Dune** - The remake of the 80's Dune was amazing to say the least. This movie (Part 1) gives us a look into the plant and why the different houses are fighting for it. Part 2 is going to be fantastic and I can't wait for it to come out.

## Hobbies I'm Active With

As mentioned up top, I have gotten into development. I have started to spend more time with that as of late. Make sure to check my blog and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kylereddoch) for updates as I travel on this journey.

I also recently finished a Star Wars Lego set that was really fun. I am going to try and get more of the set so I can have a collection.
